## Overview

### Project Description

This was my second solo project at the Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path. Solo project means that you are only provided with the Figma design file and a set of requirements you need to implement in the project. There is no hand-holding or a walk-through solution with the instructor. How you solve the challenge and implement the logic is completely up to you.

A stretch goal in this project was to add 1-click-copy which was quite interesting to implement.

More features I added myself:
- user input and the instructions text next to it
- when the user enters an invalid number the instructions text will turn red
- the 'Clear password fields' button
- a hovering 'Copied!' text when the password has been copied on the clipboard

New things learned:
- generate an array of letters, numbers and symbols from the ASCII code by using String.fromCharCode()
- write specified text string to the system clipboard (1-click-copy) with clipboard.writeText()
- automatically add and remove classes using setTimeout()

The page is fully responsive.

The code has been reviewed and approved by a Scrimba instructor.
