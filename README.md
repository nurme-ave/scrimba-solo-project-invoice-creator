## Overview

### Project Description

This was my third solo project at the Scrimba's Frontend Developer Career Path. Solo project means that you are only provided with the Figma design file and a set of requirements you need to implement in the project. There is no hand-holding or a walk-through solution with the instructor. How you solve the challenge and implement the logic is completely up to you.

A stretch goal in this project was to remove items after adding them to the invoice.

New things learned:
- got a better feel of utilizing Set() and its methods (add, delete, clear)
- also used the findIndex()-method here
- worked with objects and accessed data from them

Overall, as this was my 3rd solo project at Scrimba, I felt quite comfortable with writing JavaScript here and didn't need to look it up that much anymore while writing my code.

The page is fully responsive.

The code has been reviewed and approved by a Scrimba instructor.
